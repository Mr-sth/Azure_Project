# AI-Based Claims Denial Predictor

## Problem Statement
Claims denials are costly and often preventable. Providers struggle to understand payer rules and submission errors. Predicting denials before submission can reduce rework and improve revenue cycle management.

## Task
Train a binary classification model to predict the likelihood of claim denials. Use features such as:

- Procedure codes
- Provider type
- Payer ID

## Required Outcome
A predictive tool that:

- Flags high-risk claims
- Provides model performance metrics
- Includes a dashboard for claim review

## AI Concept
- Binary Classification
- Feature Engineering

## Data Engineering
- Claims history ingestion
- Model training
- Scoring pipeline

# 🏥 AI-Based Claims Denial Predictor

## 📌 Problem Statement
Claims denials are costly and often preventable. Providers struggle to understand payer rules and submission errors. Predicting denials before submission can reduce rework and improve revenue cycle management.

**Goal:** Train a binary classification model to predict claim denial likelihood.  
**Impact:** Proactively flag high-risk claims → improve clean claim rate, reduce appeals, and speed up cash flow.

## 📊 Data Requirements
A historical claims dataset with both paid & denied claims is required. Example fields:

- Claim-Level: Claim ID, Claim Amount, Claim Type, Submission Date, Resubmission Flag  
- Provider & Facility: Provider ID, Provider Type, Specialty, Facility Type  
- Payer: Payer ID, Plan Type (Commercial, Medicare, Medicaid)  
- Procedure & Diagnosis: CPT/HCPCS Codes, ICD-10 Codes, Number of Procedures  
- Target Variable: `denied_flag` (1 = Denied, 0 = Paid)  

## 🔧 Solution Approach

### 1️⃣ Data Engineering
- Ingest raw claims data (SQL, CSV, Snowflake, Oracle, etc.)
- Handle missing values and normalize categorical fields
- Scale numerical features (e.g., log-transform claim amount)

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Denial frequency by procedure code + payer
- Provider’s historical denial rate
- Claim amount buckets (Low/Medium/High)
- Time-based submission features

### 3️⃣ Model Training
- **Baseline:** Logistic Regression (interpretability)  
- **Advanced:** Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM  
- **Optional:** Deep Learning (Tabular Transformers)  

**Evaluation Metrics:**  
- AUC-ROC → classification power  
- Precision, Recall → focus on false negatives  
- F1 Score → balance  

### 4️⃣ Model Scoring Pipeline
- **Input:** New claim record (procedure code, provider, payer, etc.)  
- **Output:** Denial probability (0–1)  
- **Threshold:** Flag claims where p(denial) > 0.7  

## 📊 Dashboard for Claim Review
**Example: High-Risk Claims Table**

| Claim ID | Provider    | Payer   | CPT   | Predicted Risk | Status        |
|----------|------------|--------|-------|----------------|---------------|
| C001     | Dr. Smith  | Aetna  | 99213 | 0.82           | ⚠️ High Risk  |
| C002     | Dr. Lee    | Medicare | 99285 | 0.15           | ✅ Low Risk   |

**Key Features:**  
- % of claims flagged high risk  
- Top denial-prone CPT codes  
- Denial trends by payer & provider  
- Confusion Matrix + ROC Curve  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Data Engineering:** Python (Pandas, SQL), Airflow  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM  
- **Dashboard:** Power BI, Tableau, or Streamlit  
- **Deployment:** Flask/FastAPI, Docker  

## 🎯 Expected Outcome
- **Predictive AI Tool:** Flags high-risk claims before submission  
- **Operational Dashboard:** Provides billing teams with actionable insights  
- **Business Impact:** Prevent 10–30% of denials, reduce appeals, improve cash flow
