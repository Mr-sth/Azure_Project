AI-Based Claims Denial Predictor Problem Statement: 

Claims denials are costly and often preventable. Providers struggle to understand payer rules and submission errors. 
Predicting denials before submission can reduce rework and improve revenue cycle management. 

Task: Train a binary classification model to predict claim denials likelihood. Use features like procedure codes, provider type, and payer ID. 

Required Outcome: A predictive tool that flags high risk claims. Include model performance metrices and dashboard for claim review. 

AI Concept: Binary Classification, Feature Engineering. 

Data Engineering: Claims history ingestion, model trainning, scoring pipeline.
